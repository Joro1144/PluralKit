# PluralKit

PluralKit is a bot designed for plural communities on Discord. It allows you to register systems, maintain system information, set up message proxying, log switches, and more.

This bot detects messages with certain tags associated with a profile, then replaces that message under a "pseudo-account" (or fake account) of that profile using webhooks. This is useful for multiple people sharing one body (aka "systems"), people who wish to roleplay as different characters without having to create several accounts, or anyone else who may want to post messages as a different person from the same account as them.

#### How It Works:
